# chatbot_demo
This is a demo chatbot for the AWS chatbot challenge at EU Women in Tech 2017. 

Meet WinTech Bot by Duoja that helps you to enjoy the EU Women In Tech conference better. The bot is powered by AWS Lex and Lambda, and connected to Facebook as the frontend. You can soon test it live by messaging [Duoja on Facebook]( https://www.facebook.com/duoja/) after we complete the pre-launch review there.

You can talk to the bot to check the conference agenda and book the session you want to attend. You can also rate the session afterwards to provide feedbacks to the conference.

And it doesnâ€™t stop here! In real use cases, we can connect the bot to other services such as AWS S3 and DynamoDB to provide conference goers a smart experience and conference organizers the comprehensive data to improve their work.
